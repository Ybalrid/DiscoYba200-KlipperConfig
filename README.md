# DiscoYba200 Configuration

This is the klipper configuration files for my modified Dagoma DiscoVery/Easy 200 3D printer running on a BTT SKR 1.4 board.

More info at the top of `printer.cfg`. The machine started its life as a Dagoma Disovery 200 bought in 2016.

Since then it has had the following modifiation:

- Most 3d printed parts replaced with the parts for the Dagoma DiscoEasy 200 (as they are more sturdy)
- Z drive modified to use T8 lead screws
- heated bed (MK3 aluminium PCB)
- flex plate system from BuildTak
- Energetic PEI coated spring steel sheet
- Print head from the Dagoma DiscoUltimate
- 8 bit melzi replaced with a 32bit BTT SKR 1.4, running Klipper with an Orange Pi 3 LTS as its brain
